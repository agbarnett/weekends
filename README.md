# Researchers working out-of-hours
Examining submissions and reviews to two journals (_BMJ_ and _BMJ Open_) on weekends, early mornings / late nights, and holidays.

The files are:
* Lists of national holidays used in countries with holiday data available (`holidays.md`)
* Countries that do not have Saturday to Sunday weekend (`weekend.defintion.md`)
* R and Rmarkdown files to manage data and run the analyses
* `Sessioninfo.txt` gives the version of R and the libraries
* Protocol in Word
* Data in subfolder
* Selected figures in subfolder

The data subfolder contains the RData used to run the analysis after processing to remove excluded submissions.
